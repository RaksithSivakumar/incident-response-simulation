# Incident Response Simulation Tool

## Overview

The Incident Response Simulation Tool is designed to help users practice incident response procedures in a controlled, simulated environment. Users can select a predefined cybersecurity scenario and respond to it by taking a series of actions. The tool evaluates the user's decisions based on best practices and predefined incident response guidelines, providing valuable feedback for learning and improvement.

## Features
- **Scenario Selection**: Choose from a list of predefined incident scenarios, such as network breaches, phishing attacks, data leaks, etc.

- **Action Selection**: For each scenario, a set of possible actions will be presented. Select the actions you believe are appropriate to respond to the incident.

- **Evaluation and Feedback**: After submitting your response, the tool will evaluate your choices and provide feedback on which actions were correct or incorrect, helping you understand proper incident response procedures.

## Predefined Scenarios

- **Network Breach**: Respond to a potential security breach involving unauthorized access to a company's network.
Phishing Attack: Identify and respond to a phishing email targeting employees.

- **Data Leak**: Address the exposure of sensitive customer data through a compromised application.

- **Ransomware Attack**: Manage a ransomware attack that encrypts critical company files.

- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Respond to a distributed denial of service attack on a critical server.
